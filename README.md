Merge Sort Visualizer

This project is a Merge Sort Visualizer built using Python and Pygame. It graphically demonstrates how the Merge Sort algorithm works by showing a set of bars (representing numbers) being split, compared, and merged step-by-step in real time.

Features:

✅ Real-time visualization of the Merge Sort algorithm  
✅ Interactive GUI built with Pygame
✅ Regenerate random number list anytime  
✅ Toggle between ascending and descending sort  
✅ Step-by-step animation using Python generators

How It Works:

Each number is represented as a vertical bar on the screen.
The Merge Sort algorithm runs recursively and yields at each comparison and merge step.
The screen updates in real time to reflect the sorting progress.
Buttons are provided to:
  Start Sorting
  Generate New List
  Toggle Ascending/Descending

Technologies Used:

Python 3
Pygame (for GUI and animations)
