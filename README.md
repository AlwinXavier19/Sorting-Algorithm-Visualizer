This project is a Merge Sort Visualizer built using Python and Pygame. It graphically demonstrates how the Merge Sort algorithm works by showing a set of bars (representing numbers) being split, compared, and merged step-by-step in real time.

Users can:

Start the sorting animation

Generate a new list of random numbers

Choose ascending or descending sort order

Understand how merge sort divides and conquers

Itâ€™s perfect for beginners learning sorting algorithms or anyone who wants to visualize how Merge Sort works under the hood.
